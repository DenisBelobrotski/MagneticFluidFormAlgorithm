# Magnetic fluid form algorithm
This is the module that contains two algorithms for the numerical solution of the problem of the effect of the concentration of particles in a magnetic fluid on its equilibrium form in the non-uniform magnetic field of a vertical conductor.
## Algorithms
- Finite-difference method
- Tangential method
## Extra
This repository is a submodule of the [main repository](https://github.com/DenisBelobrotski/MagneticFluidFormProblemSolution) (my degree project).
